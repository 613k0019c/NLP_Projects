# Homework Requirement
1. Basic Task (Report):
   * Replicate the Bert-NER Model.
2. Bonus Tasks:
   * What if we use BiLSTM / XLNet rather than BERT? You can try another model and compare the results between BERT and the others.
   * Using gradio to show your inference results for some examples, you need to keep the screenshot and write down your observation.
